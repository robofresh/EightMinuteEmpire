1. Open the project in Visual Studio
  --> File --> Open --> Project/Solution --> Find project folder and open .sln file
2. Remove all but the driver to be tested
  --> Removing just from the project open in Visual Studio
  --> Right click on a driver file --> Remove --> Remove (NOT Delete). 
3. Hit CTRL+F5 to build the project and run the main() function in the driver file. 
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for the remaining drivers. To add a driver to project:
  --> Right click on Source Files --> Add --> Existing Items --> Select driver you want add. 


Alternatively, if you are not using visual studio, please compile each header and .cpp file.
You will also need to comment each driver file you are not testing to avoid conflicting main() functions.
